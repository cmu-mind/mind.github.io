              <b>PhD researchers:</b> We generally recruit self-motivated and talented
              students working in AI, decision-making, reinforcement learning every year.
              If you are a prospective PhD student, thank you for your
              interest! Please apply through various CMU SCS PhD programs (ML,
              CS, RI). The lab can recruit students from all of these
              programs, with a slight preference towards CS and ML.
              <b>
                Please do not email Aviral or current students before the admissions, since
                the decisions are at made at the department level by a committee.
              </b>
              <i>
                If you are <b>already</b> admitted to a CMU PhD program and
                want to explore the possibility of working in the lab,
                please email Aviral with your resume and a short
                description of your interests.
              </i>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>MS and Undergraduate researchers:</b> If you are a current MS
              or undergraduate student in SCS at CMU, and are interested in
              getting involved in our research, please apply to the lab using
              this form: <a href="https://forms.gle/MHTkMnqS6vPvGVuT7">https://forms.gle/MHTkMnqS6vPvGVuT7</a> (this form requires a CMU login). 
              We periodically update this form and check responses. 
              We recruit undergraduate researchers at all class
              levels, though a background in AI and machine learning, as well as
              excellent grades, are preferred. We typically interview new
              undergraduate / MS researchers at the beginning of the semester but we
              might also interview students at other times.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Visitors and Post-Docs:</b> If you are not a current CMU
              student, chances are that at least in academic year 2024-2025, we
              will likely not be able to support you for in-person visits.
              However, we might be able to support some remote collaborations.
              If you are interested in this option, please send over an email of
              what you are interested in along with a rough background to Prof.
              Kumar. We are not hiring postdoctoral fellows at this time.
